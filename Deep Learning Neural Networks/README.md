# Project Assignment

This project is based on the iWildCam 2019 Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/iwildcam-2019-fgvc6/overview). However, rather than accomplish the stated objective,
i. e., using animal images from one location (`train_images`) to train a network to classify animals in images taken from a different location (`test_images`), training,
validation, and testing were performed only on the images contained in `train_images`.
